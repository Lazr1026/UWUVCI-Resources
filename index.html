<p>GUIDE :</p>

<p>- Choose a base from the dropdown menu.</p>
<p>- If this is your first inject enter the WiiU common Key or you can use your otp.bin from your nand backup.</p>
<p>- Enter the Title Key for the base you selected.</p>
<p>- Click Download and wait for the Base to finish downloading.</p>
<p>- Select File next to Rom path and choose the rom that you want to inject.</p>
<p>- If there are premade images on our server for the Inject then you will be offered to download them.</p>
<p>- If no images were found on the server in the above step or you wish to add your own custom images then you can do so now.</p>
<p>  - If no images are selected then it will use the fallback images made for the UWUVCI injector.</p>
<p>  - GAMEPAD IMAGE, LOGO IMAGE and BOOT SOUND are all optional.</p>
<p>- Game Name can be set to whatever you want. If you require 2 lines then seperate the lines with a | .</p>
<p>- Click Inject and wait for it to be created. This could take a while, depending on the size of your game.</p>
<p>- Once Injected select an installable format.</p>
<p>- Once WUP Packing is complete you can either click Open Folder or you can click Copy to SD to automatically copy the files to SD.</p>
<p>- Select your SD card from the dropdown box and click Copy to SD.</p>
<p>  This will copy the WUP to the /install folder on SD ready to be installed with WUP Installer GX.</p>
